# MLBStats
small terminal application written with dotnet core to rate yesterdays games.

uses the sqllite database generated by deep-field (https://github.com/longoodr/deep-field) which is is a scraper 
for the play-by-play information provided by baseball-reference.com

copy the stats.db sqlite databse into the project folder and just execute 

```dotnet run```


## Notes

this project is WIP and the ratings calculated are based on my very limited knowlegde of the game
of baseball. i just wanted to have an easy way of seeing which games/innings are worth watching without spoilers
now that i have an MLB.TV subscription.

so it will list yesterdays games by my Rating descing. 

- then you can either enter a game-id which will show
the ratings for each inning (No spoilers) for the specific game

- or enter ```i``` and it will show the list of the 10 best innings from yesterdays games according to my rating


To prevent spoilers
- the game details will only show regular innings (bottom 9th) 
- it will also generate a pseudo bottom 9th inning if this is skipped in the game


rating calculation can be modified in
- GameStats-> CalculateGameRating
- InningStats -> CalculateRating
